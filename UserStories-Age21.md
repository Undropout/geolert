Jenna, age 22

"As a young adult without a personal mode of transportation, I use Geolert to notify

Thomas, age 23

"As a young adult with a partying lifestyle, I use Geolert to notify my friends or family that 
I've arrived safely at home, especially because I don't know if I'll be sober enough to remember to
send a message myself."

work or home with no issues, especially on days when whether is extreme."
